# History of Snake

### **Origins (1976)**
The concept of Snake originated with the arcade game **Blockade**, released by Gremlin in 1976. The gameplay was straightforward: players controlled a line that grew as it moved, and the objective was to avoid colliding with obstacles, including one’s own trail. Blockade laid the groundwork for the mechanics that Snake games would build upon.

### **Nokia's Snake (1997)**
Snake gained worldwide recognition when it was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1997. Developed by **Taneli Armanto**, this version of Snake introduced the game to millions of users. The simplicity of the game, combined with the ubiquity of Nokia phones, made Snake a cultural phenomenon. The game became synonymous with mobile gaming and is considered one of the first mainstream mobile games.

### **Evolution**
Over the years, Snake has undergone numerous iterations and adaptations:
- **Early PC Versions**: Variants of Snake appeared on early personal computers, including versions in QBasic and BASIC.
- **Modern Remakes**: Games like "Slither.io" brought multiplayer functionality and enhanced graphics to the classic formula.
