# Introduction to Tetris
Tetris is one of the most iconic and influential video games of all time. Created in 1984 by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov, the game is a masterpiece of simplicity and challenge. The name "Tetris" is a combination of "tetra" (the Greek prefix meaning "four") and "tennis," which was Pajitnov's favorite sport.

The game is based on the geometric manipulation of falling blocks, called "Tetriminos," each made up of four squares. Players must rotate and position these shapes to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear, clearing space on the playing field.

# The History of Tetris
### Origins (1984)
Alexey Pajitnov developed Tetris while working at the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. The first version of the game ran on the Elektronika 60 computer and was later ported to the IBM PC. The game quickly became popular among Pajitnov's colleagues and spread throughout the Soviet Union.

### Global Expansion
In 1986, Tetris began its journey to the West when it caught the attention of British software entrepreneur Robert Stein. After a complex series of negotiations and licensing disputes involving various companies, including Nintendo, Tengen, and Atari, Tetris found its way onto a wide array of platforms.

The most notable moment in Tetris history came in 1989, when Nintendo included Tetris as a pack-in game for its Game Boy handheld console. This move was a massive success and played a crucial role in cementing Tetris as a global phenomenon.

### Modern Versions
Over the years, Tetris has been adapted to countless platforms, including PCs, consoles, smartphones, and arcade machines. Modern iterations, such as Tetris Effect and Tetris 99, have added new dimensions to the gameplay, blending classic mechanics with innovative visuals, multiplayer competition, and immersive soundtracks.
