# Bulls and Cows
Bulls and Cows is a classic code-breaking game that tests players' deductive reasoning and logical thinking skills. The game is typically played with two players, where one player sets a secret code, and the other attempts to guess it within a limited number of turns. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating how close the guess is to the secret code using the terms "bulls" and "cows."

- **Bulls**: These represent digits in the guess that are correct and in the correct position.
- **Cows**: These represent digits in the guess that are correct but in the wrong position.

For example, if the secret code is `4271` and the guess is `1234`, the feedback would be 1 bull (for `2`) and 2 cows (for `4` and `1`).

# History
The origins of Bulls and Cows are somewhat obscure, but the game has been around for decades. It is believed to have originated as a traditional pen-and-paper game long before the digital era. Its simplicity and versatility made it a popular pastime among both children and adults. In the mid-20th century, Bulls and Cows gained widespread recognition and was adapted into several digital versions.

Notably, Bulls and Cows served as the inspiration for the creation of the popular board game **Mastermind**, which was patented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. Mastermind simplifies the concept by using colored pegs instead of numbers but retains the same basic mechanics of code-breaking and feedback.
